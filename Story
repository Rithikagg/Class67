The Rabbit had challenged the Tortoise to a race.
When they started racing the Rabbit was winning the race by miles so him being his cocky self decided to take a nap.
The Rabbit was in such a deep sleep the tortoise caught up and eventually won the race. 
That means slow and steady wins the race.
